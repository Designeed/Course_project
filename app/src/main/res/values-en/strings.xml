    <string name="info_set_how_work">\t\t\t\tWhen a person falls asleep, he goes through several cycles of slow and fast sleep phases. \n\n\t\t\t\tIf you wake up during the slow phase, you will feel heavy, broken and tired. It will be more difficult for you to wake up and get out of bed, which will not happen if you wake up at the end of the "fast phase". That\'s why it\'s so important to wake up at the right time. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe sleep calculator online takes into account the duration of sleep cycles, which last an average of 90 minutes. You need to specify the time when you intend to go to bed, and we will give you the answer to the question when it is better to get up in the morning to feel fully rested. \n\n\t\t\t\t The calculator also takes into account the time to fall asleep, so you do not need to add it to the wake-up schedule.</string>
    <string name="info_set_when_dream_desc">\t\t\t\tDreams occur, as a rule, in the rem sleep phase. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe latest research proves that dreams also occur during slow sleep, but their duration is shorter and they are not as emotional.</string>
